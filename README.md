### Description
The system that we are going to be developed is Blood Bank
Management System (BBMS). This is a web-based database application
system that is to be used by the blood banks or blood centers. It can act as a
means to advertise the nation wide blood donation events to the public and at
the same time allow the public to make online reservation and request for the
blood. One can register for the nearby camps. The system keeps the record
of all the donors, recipients, blood donation programs. This system also
keep track of the donor's donation records and the blood stock of different
blood types in different blood banks. This project intends to computerize the
blood and donor management system in a blood bank in order to improve the
record management efficiency for the grown size of records of data.
